        <p>Cascading Stylesheets — or CSS — is the first technology
           you should start learning after HTML. While HTML is used to
            define the structure and semantics of your content, CSS is
            used to style it and lay it out. For example, you can use
            CSS to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your
            content, split it into multiple columns,
            or add animations and other decorative features.
          </p>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Learning_pathway">
        <header>Learning pathway</header>
<p>You should learn the basics of HTML before attempting any CSS.
   We recommend that you work through our Introduction to HTML
   module first.
  In that module, you will learn about:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>CSS, starting with the Introduction to CSS module</li>
    <li>More advanced HTML modules</li>
    <li>JavaScript, and how to use it to add dynamic functionality to web pages</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Once you understand the fundamentals of HTML, we recommend
    that you learn HTML and CSS at the same time, moving back and
     forth between the two topics. This is because HTML is far more
      interesting and much more fun to learn when you apply CSS,
     and you can't really learn CSS without knowing HTML.</p>
  <p>Before starting this topic, you should also be familiar with
    using computers and using the web passively (i.e., just looking
    at it, consuming the content). You should have a basic work
    environment set up as detailed in Installing basic software
     and understand how to create and manage files, as detailed
     in Dealing with files — both of which are parts of our Getting
      started with the web complete beginner's module.</p>
  <p>It is recommended that you work through Getting started
    with the web before proceeding with this topic. However,
    doing so isn't absolutely necessary as much of what is
    covered in the CSS basics article is also covered in our
    Introduction to CSS module, albeit in a lot more detail.</p>

<section class="main-section" id="Using_CSS">
  <header>Using CSS</header>
  <p>There are 3 ways to use CSS</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Inline CSS</li>
    <li>Internal CSS</li>
    <li>External CSS</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Inline CSS</h3>
  <p>An inline CSS is used to apply a unique style to a single HTML element.</p>
<p>An inline CSS uses the style attribute of an HTML element.</p>
<p>This example sets the text color of the &lt;h1&gt; element to blue:</p>
  <pre><code> &lt;h1 style="color:blue;"&gt;This is a Blue Heading&lt;/h1&gt; </code></pre>
  <h3>Internal CSS</h3>
  <p>An internal CSS is defined in the &lt;head&gt; section of an HTML page, within a &lt;style&gt; element:</p>
  <pre><code>&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;style&gt;
    { CSS code }
    &lt;/style&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;</code></pre>
  <p>An internal CSS is used to define a style for a single HTML page.</p>
    <h4>Example</h4>
  <pre><code>	&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
    	&lt;html&gt;
    	&lt;head&gt;
    	&lt;style&gt;
    body {background-color: powderblue;}
    h1   {color: blue;}
    p    {color: red;}
    	&lt;/style&gt;
    	&lt;/head&gt;
    	&lt;body&gt;
    	&lt;h1&gt;This is a heading	&lt;/h1&gt;
    	&lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph.	&lt;/p&gt;
    	&lt;/body&gt;
    	&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
  <h3>External CSS</h3>
  <p>An external style sheet is used to define the style for many HTML pages.</p>
  <p>With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire web site, by changing one file!</p>
  <p>To use an external style sheet, add a link to it in the &lt;head&gt; section of the HTML page:</p>
  <p>In other CSS File we have:</p>
<pre><code>body { background-color: powderblue;}
  h1 { color: blue; }
  p { color: red; }
</code></pre>
<p>And then import it into HTML file using link tag</p>
<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
	&lt;html&gt;
	&lt;head&gt;
  	&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"&gt;
	&lt;/head&gt;
	&lt;body&gt;
	&lt;h1&gt;This is a heading	&lt;/h1&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph.	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/body&gt;
	&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>

      <section class="main-section" id="Modules">
        <header>Modules</header>
<p>This topic contains the following modules, in a suggested
   order for working through them.
   You should definitely start with the first one.</p>
   <h3>CSS first steps</h3>
<p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and lay out web pages — for example,
   to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your content, split it into multiple
    columns, or add animations and other decorative features. This module provides a gentle
     beginning to your path towards CSS mastery with the basics of how it works, what the syntax
      looks like, and how you can start using it to add styling to HTML.</p>
<h3>CSS building blocks</h3>
<p>This module carries on where CSS first steps left off — now you've gained
   familiarity with the language and its syntax, and got some basic experience
    with using it, its time to dive a bit deeper. This module looks at the cascade
     and inheritance, all the selector types we have available, units, sizing, styling
      backgrounds and borders, debugging, and lots more.</p>

<p>The aim here is to provide you with a toolkit for writing competent CSS and help you
   understand all the essential theory, before moving on to more specific disciplines like
    text styling and CSS layout.</p>
<h3>Styling text</h3>
<p>With the basics of the CSS language covered, the next CSS topic for you to concentrate
  on is styling text — one of the most common things you'll do with CSS.
   Here we look at text styling fundamentals, including setting font, boldness,
   italics, line and letter spacing, drop shadows and other text features.
   We round off the module by looking at applying custom fonts to your page,
    and styling lists and links.</p>
<h3>CSS layout</h3>
<p>At this point we've already looked at CSS fundamentals, how
  to style text, and how to style and manipulate the boxes that
   your content sits inside. Now it's time to look at how to place
    your boxes in the right place in relation to the viewport,
     and one another. We have covered the necessary prerequisites
      so we can now dive deep into CSS layout, looking at different
       display settings, modern layout tools like flexbox, CSS grid,
        and positioning, and some of the legacy techniques you might
         still want to know about.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Solving_common_CSS_problems">
        <header>Solving common CSS problems</header>
<p>Use CSS to solve common problems provides links to sections
  of content explaining how to use CSS to solve very common
  problems when creating a web page.
</p>
<p>From the beginning, you'll primarily apply colors to HTML
   elements and their backgrounds; change the size, shape, and
    position of elements; and add and define borders on elements.
     But there's not much you can't do once you have a solid
      understanding of even the basics of CSS. One of the best
      things about learning CSS is that once you know the fundamentals,
       usually you have a pretty good feel for what can and can't be done,
   even if you don't actually know how to do it yet!

        <h3>CSS on MDN</h3>
<p>The main entry point for CSS documentation on MDN,
   where you'll find detailed reference documentation
   for all features of the CSS language. Want to know all
    the values a property can take?
  This is a good place to go.</p>
